note right of UC2
  **Priority-based Processing**
  Uses PriorityQueue to ensure
  critical emergencies are
  handled first
  Complexity: O(log n)
end note

note right of UC6
  **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
  Calculates shortest path
  between dispatch center
  and emergency location
  Complexity: O(V² + E)
end note

note bottom of UC15
  **Frequency Analysis**
  Analyzes historical data to
  identify geographic patterns
  Threshold: ≥2 incidents
  Complexity: O(k)
end note

note right of UC10
  **Dynamic Network**
  Supports runtime addition
  of new centers and paths
  Graph uses adjacency list
  Complexity: O(1)
end note
